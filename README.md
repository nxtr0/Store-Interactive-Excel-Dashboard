Vrinda Store Interactive Excel Dashboard

In this project, I created an interactive Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize key business insights for Vrinda Store. The goal was to make data-driven decision-making easier by presenting complex sales and customer data in a clear and engaging way.

Key Highlights:
ðŸ“Œ Sales & Order Trends: A breakdown of monthly sales performance and order volumes.
ðŸ“Œ Customer Demographics: Insights into purchase patterns based on gender and age groups.
ðŸ“Œ Order Status Overview: A quick look at delivered, canceled, and refunded orders.
ðŸ“Œ Top-Selling Regions: Identification of the best-performing states in terms of revenue.
ðŸ“Œ Sales Channels Analysis: Understanding where most sales come fromâ€”Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.
ðŸ“Œ Product Performance: A closer look at the most popular product categories and sizes.

The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, allowing easy filtering and dynamic visualizations. This makes it a valuable tool for tracking business performance, spotting trends, and making informed decisions.
